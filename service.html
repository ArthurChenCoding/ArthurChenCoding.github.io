    <h1>The community that I am within</h1>
	<p>
        &emsp;I enjoy reading, great mentors for mutual learning, and socializing with new people with a different experience. 
        Therefore, I regularly participate in the reading forum, language exchange, symphony band, and hiking. In the reading forum, one of us, a group 
        of new friends, shares reflections on one of the significant books she/he has read about. This is usually a great chance 
        to interpret another perspective on the same issue. Language exchange is a more exciting activity because it is a rare 
        opportunity to chat with foreigners to practice your 2nd or 3rd language. Meanwhile, you can also teach others the language 
        that you are more familiar with.

    <p style="padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        &emsp; I've been playing saxophone alone through my childhood, I am glad that the symphony band of Texas A&M University provides me the opportunity to play music as a group. We practice weekly and often give performance for University on serval events on the campus.

    <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
        &emsp; He is one of my great mentors who I usually go hiking with. Viewing the city we see everyday from a different perspective is another form of meditation in my life.
