    <h1 >About me</h1>
	<p>
        &emsp;I am a Taiwanese who studied in an international high school in China, and now I am pursuing a computer engineering degree at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> and will graduate by the summer of 2022.
        With the opportunity to experience lifestyles in different countries, I become a cosmopolitan who is open-minded to other cultures and perspectives. Therefore, when I am working as a part of the 
        group, besides individual accountability, I believe empathy and compassion are also the keys to promote team productivity. My favorite motto is "A circuit needs all parts to be functional for the 
        light bulb to work". 
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 50px;">
        &emsp;In my spare time, I pursue habits that allows me to focus and capture the subtle moments in this dynamic world.

        &emsp;I am fascinated with the architectures and culture in Japan, which motivate me to learn my third language: Japanese.
